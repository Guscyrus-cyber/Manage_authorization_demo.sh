# Manage_authorization_demo.sh
Linux file manage authorization


This project demonstrates the practical use of Linux file and directory permissions, focusing on controlling access and privileges for users, groups, and others. The commands in this script showcase how to navigate directories, create files, and modify their permissions using utilities like chmod and ls. Key examples include setting read, write, and execute permissions for files and directories, adjusting hidden file access, and ensuring secure configurations for collaborative environments.

The script is designed for a user scenario (research2) within a group (research_team) and emphasizes common permission tasks such as removing write access for others, restricting group permissions, and modifying directory privileges. This setup provides a clear understanding of Linux's permission model, making it easier to manage secure and efficient workflows in shared or restricted environments.
