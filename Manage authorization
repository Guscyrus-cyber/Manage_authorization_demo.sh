1. Create the Directory Structure

mkdir -p /home/research2/projects/drafts

    Explanation: Creates the /home/research2/projects directory and the drafts subdirectory. The -p flag ensures parent directories are created if they don't already exist.

2. Navigate to the projects Directory

cd /home/research2/projects

    Explanation: Changes the current working directory to /home/research2/projects.

3. Create Files

touch project_a.txt project_b.txt project_k.txt project_m.txt .hidden_project

    Explanation: Creates five empty files:
        project_a.txt
        project_b.txt
        project_k.txt
        project_m.txt
        .hidden_project (a hidden file because of the . prefix).

4. Set Permissions for Files

chmod 644 project_a.txt
chmod 666 project_b.txt
chmod 644 project_k.txt
chmod 664 project_m.txt
chmod 600 .hidden_project

    Explanation:
        644: Owner can read/write, group and others can only read.
        666: Owner, group, and others can read/write.
        664: Owner can read/write, group can read/write, others can only read.
        600: Owner can read/write, no permissions for group or others.

5. Set Permissions for the drafts Directory

chmod 775 drafts

    Explanation: Grants full access (read, write, execute) to the owner and group, and read/execute access to others.

6. List Files with ls -l

ls -l

    Output: Displays the permissions, owner, group, and size of the files and directories.

7. List Hidden Files with ls -la

ls -la

    Output: Lists all files, including hidden ones (those starting with a .), with their permissions.

8. Identify Files with Write Permission

ls -l | grep "w"

    Explanation: Filters files with w (write) permissions in their permission string.

9. Remove Write Permission for Others on project_k.txt

chmod o-w project_k.txt

    Explanation: Removes write permission for "others" (o-w) on project_k.txt.

10. Check Permissions for project_m.txt

ls -l project_m.txt

    Output: Displays the permissions of project_m.txt. Initially, it had -rw-rw-r-- (read/write for owner and group, read-only for others).

11. Remove Group Read Permission for project_m.txt

chmod g-r project_m.txt

    Explanation: Removes read permission for the group (g-r). New permissions: -rw--w-r-- (write-only for group).

12. Change Permissions for .hidden_project

chmod 640 .hidden_project

    Explanation: Sets permissions so the owner can read/write, the group can read, and others have no access.

13. Remove Execute Permission for Group on drafts

chmod g-x drafts

    Explanation: Removes execute permission for the group (g-x). New permissions: drwxrw-r-x.

14. Verify Changes with ls -la

ls -la

    Output: Lists all files and directories, showing the updated permissions.
